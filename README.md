# Optimal Quoting

Research-oriented project on **optimal market making and quoting** using
**stochastic control**, **order-flow intensity models**, and **inventory risk management**.

The goal is to build a clean, reproducible framework to:
- model execution via intensity-based fills,
- design optimal quoting policies under inventory constraints,
- backtest and evaluate market making strategies in a realistic microstructure setting.

## Structure
- `src/optimal_quoting/` : core library (models, strategy, simulator)
- `configs/` : experiment configurations
- `scripts/` : runnable experiments
- `docs/` : research notes, derivations, methodology
- `tests/` : unit tests
- `reports/` : generated figures and metrics

## Roadmap
See `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
